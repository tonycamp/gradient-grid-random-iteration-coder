# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
i have done the mosaic coder experimental...
i will have to implement few more tries until the grid 16 speed 200 iterations 20000 y divisor 6 and u divisor 14 and v divisor 14 can be good image no much mosaic
or grid denotacible...
with this values you can get a dat file that after good compressors of lossless data like cmix or emma lea can acheive similar sizes like a webp file or a jxl file in quality 90
its a better size than jpg or avif 90 unfortunutlly when you check the remade png file
you see a bit of mosaic the bigger it gets the divisors...
if you wish to test in images of yours and tweak a bit the vaoues of speed for instances to less and the values of iteratios for more and the divisors can become like y 4 or u 8 and v 8
you get good quality image and resanable compressable dat file but the lower the speed values the hours it takes to compress and even more iterations you do get like 7 hours for a just 1028x768 file to compress you can use of original a jpg a bmp a tga or a png but its lossy compression ok...

its on github

you may think the 7z file contains the source, yes it does... but its not py or c its bmx (blitz max ng basic 146) -- ok do not ask me why ... im never a good coder or a good photographer or even a good graphic designer am a try out of the 3 of it.

in case you need speed you can just use iterations 1000 and limit 70 the grid 16 and yuv like 7 you get the results like the sample 1
i mean jpg 120 avif 90 webp 60 jxl 67 cmix 50 and lea 52 quality of png its still to be considered as 90 .. but its not like 90 since its got a bit of mosaic
