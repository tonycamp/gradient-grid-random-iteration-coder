# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
in the yuv channels 3 separated and range do not use bigger ranges over 64 or iterations over 100, each iteration takes 2x the timemore,  soo if 1 hours can turn into 100 hours just by using 100 iterations instead of just 1 , imagine doing imagens over 1000 iterantins
result... png remade original file can be as equal as jpg quality and the dat compressed file can be less than jxl size if dat file compresseed over lea emma compressor or similar.
decompression will take just 3 or 4 mins tops. even with 1000 iterations 16 grid range 100 and y u v 6 12 12.
