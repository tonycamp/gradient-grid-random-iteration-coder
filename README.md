SKY SODDY GRADIENT IMAGE CRUCHER V9.0 started in 2015 ZPAQ AND NZ
developments to be done / some sources in RAR too bmx 1.50.../ version 9.0 / compresses a file of image to similar lossy size of webp / decompression avaliable /image to z.jpg compresses a image file to a z.jpg storage format similiar quality and size of webp
 / z.jpg to image decompresses a z.jpg file in storage format to a rebuild remade file of jpg / folder to z.jpg reads all images in folder and sub folders and compresses like batch with multithreads all the files images formats to z.jpg / z.jpg to folder analises all the z.jpg files in folder and sub folders and builds remade jpgs out of all of them / >>>the movie buttons do not work still<<< / the enter key after putting quality number need to be used.. / the exit button its like a x on the windows top 3 buttons / 
use at your on purpouse and risk if you collapse the program in the middle of something > some trashy temp files on the folder will not be deleted.
THE DIFFERENCE FROM NZ AND ZPAQ ITS THAT ZPAQ ITS FIXED NO REALLOCATE THE Z.JPG OR WILL NOT REMADE THE FILES
AND THE NZ ITS 4X FASTER 5 PER CENT LESS COMPRESSION AND YOU MAY REALLOCATE THE Z.JPG TO ANY FOLDER AND WILL DECOMPRESS TO THE FOLDER WHERE THE Z.JPG FILE IS IN ... THE REMADE.JPG WILL BE THERE

tech its this .. you have a photo that you dont need max photo detail you can put to webp 60 quality or jxl 60 quality or avif 60 quality or even z.jpg quaity 40 hi def off or hi color off and you get a 3500x2800x24 photo over just 240kb
