# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
the zip contains samples and the dat.lea file of compressed dat file
also contains the blitz basic max bmx code
contains also the cli exe with like 5 parameters of input
i used low quality of iter 1000000, range 45, grid 8, y divisor 3, u divisor 3, divisor 3 to become like just 100Kb the samplebutterfly512.jpg example quality very relative....
the problem its you need to move some parameters to more quality and bigger size less noise in order to be a valid lossy similar image to jpg witch is 2 times more the size than the dat.lea file.
dat .lea files are compressed over emma lea compressor v0125
there are there some examples with grid 10 and grid 7 and 2 million iterations and some divisors of 4 and 6 witch can get similar results to web and jxl
but you know it will always be since its random a bit of grain still i need to remove.
