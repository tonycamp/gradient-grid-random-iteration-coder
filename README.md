# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
you can check github it got examples thereversion 10 test . zip
use parameters of gridxy 8 and 400 iterations and y 4 u 8 v 8 on divisors for example.
you get quality good and very small size... smaller than webp 88 or jxl 88 like half of it!!!!
also better than nhw. you might thing for this size and for this quality its not 88 quality or 15 quality in nhw but... we can also ask some good photographers to check.
the decompression will be made ... hopefully very fast, since no random iterations to pass. the seed and range are already stored in the dat file.
compress on this is bmx language, blitz basic max, and no multithreds can become like a image of 1800x900 px into 47 mins to code + plus the dat into the emma lea compress gui software max compression, and that also takes also 10 mins more time.

the higher specially the divisors and a bit of iterations, the higher will compress, iterations do consume a lot of time and some significant more quality soo i dont go over 3000 or more.
it really can take hours... if iterations go to 1000 or plus

the cli .... you state the name of jpg file and grid size and the iterations you wish, and in with the YUV divisors.
after a while the coded image will be into dat file.. and a original.png will be made as sample of the result of future decoding. and estimate size will be produced... you compress the dat file over the compressor you like... emma lea, paq8px, cmix,zpaq,7z,rar,zip etc , and you will check the comparation size over webp jxl avif jpg and nhw size.
you can check the quality of the made png to see how it can become decoded.
do your tests.. code and compile over the language you like, prob a better one, than blitzmax basic for instances (c++ can get good multhitread speed and good results ),
do the overall coding of compression and decompression and also the transparency, and ending green mebranes if you wish.

IF YOU DONT WISH TO WAIT 47 Mins BEST BALANCE RESULTS ARE YOU CAN TRY TO COMPRESS JUST OVER 100 or 500 ITERATIONS.
GRID 12 , y 4 , U 8, V 8, YOU STILL CAN GET ENTHROPY RESULTS BUT slightly SQUARE noticable if divisors are big.
yes and speed up the stuff to just 20 mins a image doing to iterations.

unzip the parts, bmx, exe, image formats etc test the cli exe but force windows 8 compatibility to see render in progress of the coding image. 1800x900 windows range.

version 09 and 10 got bmx blitzmax basic sources and cli and some examples of coding.

on any lossy format we need to assume that gets less quality on every Kb cutted on the final size.

the relation from y divisor and u and v divisor can be like luminisity y 5 and chromo u 10 v 10 sort of speaking.

benchmarks ....

avif quality 88 = 107kb
bmp quality 88 = 769 kb
bmp.dat quality 88 = 801 kb
bmp.dat.lea quality 88 = 44kb
bmp.original.dat.png quality 88 = 529 kb
jpg quality 88 = 184 kb
jxl quality 88 = 68 kb
nhw quality 88 (15) = 60 kb
webp quality 88 = 85 kb
