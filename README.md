# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
the zip contains samples and the lea file of compressed dat file
also contains the blits basic max bmx code
contains also the cli exe with like 8 or nine parameters of input
i used low quality of iter 0, range 35, adv 30, tolerance 25, grid 8, noise 3, y 4, u 8, v 8 to become like80% just of jxl size
the problem its you need to move some parameter to more quality and bigger size in order to be a valid lossy similar image to jpg of 3 times more the size.
