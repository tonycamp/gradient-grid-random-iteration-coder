# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
use grid xy of 16 or 24 or 32 or 48 and
use 30000 iterations
and speed range of 40 or 30 and speed of wavelet to 60
use divisor y = 10 u = 9 v = 9
you get a png made like the samples
over just 30 mins
and the lea size its similar to webp or jxl or at least avif
quality still a bit less than 90 quality of webp.

the other version its more stable the mosaic coder 2 . 7z comes with high performace in grid 16 plain speed 20 range speed 40 wavelet speed 80 and divisors of 4 and 6 you can get in just one hours
similar results of enthrophy to avif jxl and webp prob if you use instead of lea use cmix and you can see the mosica quality almost unoticable on low divisors 2 4 5 not more...
you must tweack a lot the values until you find results that can be used to be good as archiver of files by not lossing the photo too much quality maintain like the most quality possible and get the size similar to webp ,.. taht its still not achevalbe its close but no cigar..
soo more tries will be needed into the coder before im pleased with te coder and do the decoder...

that is why i do not go to try to do the decoder inbmx right now...

feel free to try to chage de code and see if you can tewak a bit better entrhopy results and quality results in order for this coder to be a good archiver even if it takes like 3 hours to compress a 1920x1080 image...

it can become good for storage format instead of webp.

and if its tewaked a lot it can go for higher values than webp of 16384x16384 pixels but thats a further try


but feel free to probe in github good coder.zip and mosaic coder 2 7z
