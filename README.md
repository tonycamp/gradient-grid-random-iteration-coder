# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
the zip contains samples and the dat.lea file of compressed dat file
also contains the blitz basic max bmx code
contains also the cli exe with like 8 or nine parameters of input
i used low quality of iter 0, range 35, adv 30, tolerance 25, grid 8, noise 3, y 4, u 8, v 8 to become like just 80% of jxl size quality very relative....
the problem its you need to move some parameters to more quality and bigger size in order to be a valid lossy similar image to jpg witch is 3 times more the size than the dat.lea file.
dat .lea files are compressed over emma lea compressor v0125
