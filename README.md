# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
use grid xy of 16 or 24 or 32 or 48 and
use 30000 iterations
and speed range of 40 or 30 and speed of wavelet to 60
use divisor y = 10 u = 9 v = 9
you get a png made like the samples
over just 30 mins
and the lea size its similar to webp or jxl or at least avif
quality still a bit less than 90 quality of webp.
