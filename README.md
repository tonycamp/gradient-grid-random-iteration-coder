# gradient-grid-random-iteration-coder
plain coder 
use grid 10x10 
use random range speed 16
use wavelet speed of 16

wait 5 hours one thread on a jpg image of 1024x717px like amostra 3 .jpg
and you can compress the dat file over just 220Kb
like webp or jxl of 90% quality
even better than jpg or avif
the tweaks over the non good pixels will be done...
